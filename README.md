P4QuickMergeUtil is a quick and dirty script to aid in merging directories and files from one depot/stream to another.
This script assumes a 1 to 1 mapping of the stream's contents and exists for the purpose of working and merging between multiple
Unreal Engine projects in different depots / streams.
